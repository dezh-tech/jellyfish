					JellyFish Realy Terms of Service
				</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="flex justidy-start lg:pl-80 pt-28">
				This Terms of Sevice was provided by Nostream and edited for nostr.wine and this is an
				updated version for JellyFish.
				<br />
				<br />
				This terms of service is in beta version and its a subject to change.
				<br />
				<br />
				This page contains the terms of service for all JellyFish services and projects.
				<br />
				Email support: jelly@dezh.tech
				<br />
				Nostr support: _@jellyfish.land
				<br />
				<br />

				By joining to JellyFish relays, you agree:
				<br />
				<br />
				* To not engage in spam.
				<br />
				* To not flood.
				<br />
				* To not expect content moderation.
				<br />
				* To not misuse or abuse the relay service and other supporting services.
				<br />
				* That requests to delete content you publish cannot be guaranteed in all relays and only it
				will be removed from JellyFish relays.
				<br />
				* That this relay has no control over any content published in other relays
				<br />
				* That the service might be revoked to you at the operator's sole discretion if found in violation
				of these terms
				<br />
				* To use the service in good faith and not seek to get the relay operator(s) in trouble
				<br />
				* That the content you publish to this relay will be further broadcasted to any interested client
				and/or accepting relay
				<br />
				<br />

				In addition you understand that:
				<br />
				<br />
				* All JellyFish sales are final - NO refunds, returns, or cancellations.
				<br />
				* Nostr is a decentralized and distributed network of relays that relays data by users.
				<br />
				* Censorship resistance is practiced by posting to multiple relays and running your own private
				relay.
				<br />
				* The responsibility of filtering and moderating is the sole responsibility of the users and
				not of the relays.
				<br />
				* You may be inadvertently exposed to content that you might find triggering, disturbing, distasteful,
				immoral or against your views.
				<br />
				* The relay operator is not liable and has no involvement in the type, quality and legality of
				the content being produced by users of the relay.
